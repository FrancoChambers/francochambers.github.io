    heading: "Evolution of Franco Chambers"
    text: "Sometime in the later half of 1978 after graduating from the Hugh Wooding Law School, Tillman Thomas started a legal practice as a Sole Practitioner in Grenville, St. Andrew and Sauteurs, St. Patrick in the State of Grenada.  Within two years, that is, in 1980, Ms. Maureen Emmanuel joined Mr. Tillman Thomas and they formed a partnership,  Thomas and Emmanuel with an additional office located in the heart of the capital city  on Granby Street in St. George’s. The partnership started to flourish; however on 11th July, 1981, Mr. Thomas was detained by the People's Revolutionary Government as a counter-revolutionary. His detention placed a strain on the partnership which became very difficult for Ms. Emmanuel to sustain, manage and maintain all by herself. The partnership died a natural death a few months after its establishment. After he was released from detention following the U.S and Caribbean Intervention in October 1983, Mr. Thomas again started as a Sole practitioner with office space at the Chambers of Attorney-at-Law, Lloyd Noel in St. Georges.  Lloyd also had a well established and flourishing practice before they were both detained in 1981. Mr. Thomas also reopened his offices at Sauteurs, St. Patrick and Grenville, St. Andrew. During that time he became actively involved in party political activities. In December 1984 he was elected as the member of Parliament for St. Patrick East and accepted a post within the Government. He suspended his legal practice while serving as a Minister of Government.  In March 1987 he resigned from Government but instead of devoting his time solely to the practice of Law he was actively involved in the formation a new political party.  This party formed the Government in 1990 and he was again appointed a Government Minister. This meant the closure of his practice for yet another time. He began to focus more on his practice following his party defeat at the 1995 General Elections although still actively involved in politics. In 2000 after being elected leader of the National Democratic Congress he continued to practice the law balancing his time between politics and law. He was appointed Leader of the Opposition following the 2003 General Elections. He managed  both the  legal practice and the Office of the Leader of the Opposition. When he was appointed Prime Minister in July 2008, his youngest brother, Andre, then an Attorney continued practice. In 2009 Franco Chambers & Co.was formed. In 2014 Mr. Tillman Thomas eldest daughter Rae, who was qualified as an Attorney joined the Firm as an Associate with Tillman and Andre being Senior partners."

He then continued his education at the University of the West Indies from 1973 - 1978 where he pursued a Bachelor of Law (LLB) and his certification of Legal Education. He is the longest practicing member of the team and it was his dream that led to the establishment known today as Franco Chambers."
