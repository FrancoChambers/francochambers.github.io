    text: "Sometime in the later half of 1978 after graduating from the Hugh Wooding Law School, Tillman Thomas started a legal practice as a Sole Practitioner in Grenville, St. Andrew and Sauteurs, St. Patrick in the State of Grenada.  In 1980, Ms. Maureen Emmanuel joined Mr. Tillman Thomas and they formed a partnership.  Thomas & Emmanuel established an additional office located in the heart of the capital city  on Granby Street in St. George’s. The partnership started to flourish; however on 11th July, 1981, Mr. Thomas was detained by the People's Revolutionary Government as a counter-revolutionary. His detention placed a strain on the partnership which became very difficult for Ms. Emmanuel to sustain, manage and maintain all by herself. The partnership died a natural death a few months after its establishment. After he was released from detention following the U.S and Caribbean Intervention in October 1983, Mr. Thomas again started as a Sole practitioner with office space at the Chambers of Attorney-at-Law, Lloyd Noel in St. Georges.  Lloyd had a well established and flourishing practice before they were both detained in 1981. Mr. Thomas also reopened his offices at Sauteurs, St. Patrick and Grenville, St. Andrew. During that time he became actively involved in party political activities. In December 1984 he was elected as the member of Parliament for St. Patrick East and accepted a post within the Government. He suspended his legal practice while serving as a Minister of Government. Apart from serving as a minister of Government between December 1984 and  March 1987 and 1990 and 1995 and as Prime Minister from July 2008 to the middle of February 2013 he has devoted his life to the practice of the law notwithstanding his involvement in party political activities. Franco Chambers & Co. was incorporated and established in 2009 by Andre Thomas while Tillman was serving as Prime Minister. Andre managed the company single handedly until 2013 when Tillman returned to practicing law. Tillman and Andre are currently senior partners of the Company and Rae, an Associate."
